# The-melody-still-returns
Translation of Alterman's עוד חוזר הניגון

The melody that you’ve neglected in vain still returns
and the road still opens its eyes to its length
and a cloud in its skies and a tree in its rains
still await you, wayfarer.

And the wind will rise and and in flight of swings
the lightnings will pass over you
and a lamb and a deer will bear witness 
that you've patted them and kept on walking

That your hands are empty and your city is far 
and more than once you worshiped 
a green orchard and a woman in her laughter 
and the rained tree tops eyelids.
